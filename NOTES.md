## 🚀 Parallel Data Processing (Performance Notes)

`OpenCCJava` is designed with performance in mind and supports **parallel data processing** internally when appropriate. Here's what users and developers should know:

### ✅ Implementation Highlights

- The dictionary-based replacement engine supports fast, large-scale segment matching.
- Internally optimized using efficient lookup maps and max-length scanning for longest match.
- While Java does not provide native SIMD-like performance for string operations, the architecture is designed to **minimize allocations** and leverage **loop-level parallelism** where applicable.

### ⚙️ Java-Level Parallelization

To take full advantage of multicore processors:
- **You can split large inputs** and run conversions in parallel using Java’s parallel streams or thread pools.
- `OpenCC` instances are **stateless after initialization**, so you can safely use them across threads.

```java
List<String> inputLines = Files.readAllLines(Path.of("large_input.txt"));
OpenCC cc = new OpenCC("s2t");

// Convert in parallel
List<String> converted = inputLines.parallelStream()
    .map(cc::convert)
    .toList();
```

> ⚠️ Be sure to reuse the same `OpenCC` instance rather than creating one per thread to avoid redundant dictionary loading.

### 📏 Recommended Use Cases

- Bulk document translation (e.g. articles, subtitles, corpus).
- Web or server-side APIs processing user content.
- Large list processing, where each entry is independently convertible.

### 🚫 Caution

- Avoid using parallelism **inside** the `convert(...)` method itself. The class is designed to be thread-safe **per call**, but not internally parallel.
- Excessive thread spawning for very short strings may reduce performance due to overhead.

### 🧪 Benchmark Tips

- Use a thread pool (`ExecutorService`) or parallel streams for long texts or batch inputs.
- Profile with `jmh`, `VisualVM`, or Rider's built-in CPU profiler if tuning performance.
